# hexavalent

Write Hexchat plugins in Rust.

Read [the docs](https://docs.rs/hexavalent) or see the examples directory to get started.

## Why the name?

"Hex" from HexChat, of course. "Hexavalent" because CrO<sub>3</sub> looks similar to Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.

...and hexavalent chromium is unsafe to handle, much like HexChat's API.
